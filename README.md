# Wildflower Tracker

## Track nature's blooms with ease 

**What will the application do?**
- This application will allow users to track the wildflowers 
they spot outdoors by entering the type of wildflower that
was spotted, the location/date it was seen and an image. 
Possible features include the ability to view through the total
different types of wildflowers seen so far, statistics about 
which location has the most variety of flowers, when is the best time of 
year to see certain types of wildflowers and a chart visualizing the
trends when is peak wildflower season in each location. 

**Who will use it?**
- This application can be used by a variety of demographics and ages, from 
children tracking wildflowers in local parks, to back country hikers wanting to know
when is the best time to spot alpine flowers in the mountains. Primarily, it will target users
who have an interest in the outdoors and nature. 

**Why is this project of interest to you?** 
- Wildflowers are beautiful to see - but many species (especially in alpine conditions)
only bloom for a short time during the year. With so many beautiful hikes around
BC, I hope that this application can help other wildflower-enthusiasts
better understand the blooming cycles around them, and act as a diary of 
their outdoor adventures! Finally, due to the ramifications of climate change, these blooming 
cycles have been directly impacted over the past few years, with many species 
blooming earlier due to warmer conditions. I hope that this application can also provide 
valuable data on how environments around us is changing.
